This program has 2 versions of UCS and A* search for traversing through a weighted graph and maze, and one implementation of Breadth First Search to be used in maze. All algorithms uses a dictionary to represent the graphs.

The mazes are represented via .txt file format where "W" is used for walls, "E" is used for empty grids, "S" is used for starting position and "G" is used for the goal position.

The code can be compiled and run through a Python 3.11 IDE. I've used PyCharm to do this assignment.
